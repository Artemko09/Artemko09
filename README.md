## 💀 Cyberrunner: Zhuk Artem  

💾 __Code is freedom__. I carve my own path through the stack, mastering __HTML__, __CSS__, __React__, and __Git__. Lines of code shape the digital skyline, and I intend to leave my mark.    
🌆 __The web is my Night City__, where every pixel matters, every transition is smooth, and every interaction is seamless. A place where creativity meets logic, and design meets efficiency.    
🔍 __Always one step ahead, always looking for something more.__ The next framework, the next challenge, the next breakthrough—stagnation is not an option.      
⛓ __Wake up, netrunner. It’s time to rewrite the system.__ Let’s build something truly legendary, pushing the limits of what’s possible in this neon-lit digital frontier.  
🐍 __Meanwhile, I’m diving into the depths of backend development__, mastering __Python__, __MongoDB__, __APIs__, __databases__, and everything in between. The full stack is the goal, and I won’t stop until I break through every limitation.
💻 __But the story doesn’t end here. C# is the next frontier.__ The code I will wield, the challenges I will conquer. I’ll carve __my name__ into its framework and dominate the system.
📡 __You can find me here__. But remember: __in this world, you either code or get coded__. Choose wisely.
